# First query - pulling various information about customers and which products they bought

SELECT CUSTOMERS.CUS_ID, PROD_ID, PROD_TYPE, PROD_PRICE
FROM PRODUCTS, CUSTOMERS, INVOICE
WHERE CUSTOMERS.CUS_ID = INVOICE.CUS_ID
AND INVOICE.INVOICE_ID = PRODUCTS.INVOICE_ID;

# Second query - used to see customers and the types of services (i.e. screen replacement)

SELECT CUSTOMERS.CUS_ID, SERVICE_ID, SERVICE_TYPE, SERVICE_PRICE
FROM SERVICES, CUSTOMERS, APPOINTMENT
WHERE CUSTOMERS.CUS_ID = APPOINTMENT.CUS_ID
AND APPOINTMENT.APPOINTMENT_ID = SERVICES.APPOINTMENT_ID;

# Third query - used to see which products are sold in which store (i.e. store #4 only sells iphone 8)

SELECT STORES.STORE_ID, PRODUCTS.PROD_ID, PROD_TYPE, PROD_PRICE
FROM PRODUCTS, STORES
WHERE STORES.STORE_ID = PRODUCTS.STORE_ID;

# Fourth query - used to determine which vendors sell which products

SELECT VENDORS.VENDOR_ID, PRODUCTS.PROD_ID, PROD_TYPE, PROD_PRICE
FROM VENDORS, PRODUCTS
WHERE VENDORS.VENDOR_ID = PRODUCTS.VENDOR_ID;

# Fifth query - pulling information about stores and which services they provide

SELECT STORES.STORE_ID, SERVICES.SERVICE_ID, SERVICE_TYPE, SERVICE_PRICE
